gy-251-i2c-accelerometer-and-gyroscope
======================================

Overview
--------

The GY-251 example measures acceleration and angular velocity with 3 degrees
of liberty each. The purpose of this sample is to show how to use a sensor
that uses I2C communication protocol.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements
------------

The demo assumes that GY-251 SCL pin is connected to the 0.27 pin and SDA pin
is connected to the 0.26 pin.
Make sure to use VDD OUT (or 5V output if using DK board) as the positive
reference and GND as the negative reference.
